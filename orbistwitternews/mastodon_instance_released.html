                <h2>Mastodon Instance Created!!!! </h2>
                <p class="published-date">Published on July 27, 2023</p>
                <p>Last night marked a groundbreaking moment as Orbis Twitter made its debut on Mastodon. Designed to revolutionize the Politics & War (PnW) game, this innovative platform aims to transform the gameplay experience forever. While PnW admirably simulates real-world dynamics, no one had ventured into creating a "social media" based on the real world until now â€“ a bold and unprecedented undertaking.</p>

                <p>The visionary behind this remarkable initiative is none other than Kaiser Wilhelm, who spearheaded the establishment of Orbis Twitter on Discord. This momentous step brings a fresh perspective to the game, adding a social media dimension that promises to reshape interactions among players.</p>

                <p>Mr. Wilhelm, in a candid statement, acknowledged that this Mastodon instance is a temporary endeavor and its continuity hinges on adequate funding. He emphasized that should the platform experience prolonged inactivity, it will gracefully transition back to its roots on the Discord Server within the next month.</p>

                <p>With costs carefully calculated, the sustainability of this venture has been a matter of concern. Operating the server incurs a monthly expenditure of $9, while maintaining the domain orbistwitter.com entails an annual cost of $12.</p>

                <p>Despite the uncertainty, the Orbis Twitter community remains steadfast. The Discord server continues to thrive, with traffic seamlessly redirected to the new Mastodon platform at https://mastodon.orbistwitter.com. The momentum and enthusiasm among players signify a profound interest in embracing this bold evolution of the game.</p>

                <p>As the sun sets on the horizon of possibilities, the fate of Orbis Twitter awaits, balancing on the precipice of a transformative journey in the world of Politics & War. Will this social media-inspired endeavor leave an indelible mark on the game, ushering in an era of unprecedented dynamics? Only time will reveal the answer to this extraordinary tale.</p>
